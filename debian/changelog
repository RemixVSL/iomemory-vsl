iomemory-vsl (3.2.10.1509-1.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Release.
  * GENERAL CHANGES
  * ---------------
  * 
  * General Improvements and Features
  * 
  *         * The fio-sure-erase utility now reports the device serial number upon
  *           completion.
  *         * The fio-status utility now provides the thresholds for when
  *           performance throttling engages due to high temperature conditions at
  *           the controller or NAND memory devices. These values can be used by
  *           customer management processes to predict when high temperature
  *           conditions will impact device performance or when additional cooling
  *           measures need to be taken. Example
  *           output:
  *                 fio-status -fj
  * 
  *                         "controller_throttle_start_deg_c" : "78",
  *                         "nand_throttle_start_deg_c" : "78",
  * 
  * Fixed General Issues
  * 
  *         ISSUE: Under specific workloads and in specific system environments a
  *                customer may experience longer than expected latencies on
  *                ioMemory devices.
  *                The behavior has been reported with ioMemory VSL 3.2.x. The
  *                frequency of occurrence is dependent on the workload and system
  *                environment.
  *         RESOLUTION: This release includes fixes that reduce the frequency of
  *                     latency spikes in many scenarios.
  * 
  * 
  * WINDOWS CHANGES
  * ---------------
  * 
  * Fixed Windows Issues
  * 
  *         ISSUE: If your system is using a storage device in addition to an
  *                ioMemory device, the system may show duplicate SCSI IDs causing
  *                conflicts.
  *         RESOLUTION: Use the fio-config utility and the WIN_SCSI_BUS_ID module
  *                     parameter to set the device ID for all ioMemory devices to
  *                     a SCSI ID number that doesn't conflict with other SCSI
  *                     devices. See the fio-config section in the Command Utilities
  *                     section of the ioMemory VSL User Guide for Windows for more
  *                     information.
  * 
  *         ISSUE: When more than one process tries to access PCI device information
  *                (for example running multiple instances of fio-pci-check in
  *                parallel), the first process will erroneously return information
  *                for a later process.
  *         RESOLUTION: The configuration information is locked so only one process
  *                     can access it at a time.
  * 
  * 
  * LINUX CHANGES
  * -------------
  * 
  * Linux Improvements and Features
  * 
  *         * Added DKMS support for Linux source packages. When you update the
  *         system kernel and DKMS is installed and configured correctly, the
  *         ioMemory VSL software will be configured for the new kernel. This
  *         includes updates to ioMemory VSL driver loading configuration.
  *         * Improved kernel configuration code for building from source.
  * 
  * Fixed Linux Issues
  * 
  *         ISSUE: When the Linux operating system issued an incorrectly formed
  *                request the ioMemory VSL software would crash.
  *         RESOLUTION: The ioMemory VSL software now rejects the invalid request.
  * 
  *         ISSUE: When building the software package from source, the 'make clean'
  *                option would fail.
  *         RESOLUTION: This option now works as expected.
  * 
  *         ISSUE: Updating the system kernel or ioMemory VSL software would insert
  *                the ioMemory VSL software into the initrd and ignore the software
  *                configuration file (/etc/modprobe.d/iomemory-vsl.conf). This
  *                issue created software loading issues that required dracut to
  *                fix.
  *         RESOLUTION: Multiple solutions to this configuration issue:
  *                 1) If DKMS is installed and configured the ioMemory VSL software
  *                    is configured for the new kernel.
  *                 2) If dracut is installed, the ioMemory VSL software uses that
  *                    program to fix the configuration issue.
  *                 3) If both the fio-sysvinit and fio-common packages are
  *                    installed, the ioMemory VSL software is excluded from the
  *                    initrd.
  * 
  * 
  * VMWARE CHANGES
  * --------------
  * 
  * Fixed VMware Issues
  * 
  *         ISSUE: An imbalance in process queue sizes would cause the ioMemory VSL
  *                software for ESXi to become unresponsive and log errors that the
  *                SCSILinuxQueueCommand had failed. This could cause caching
  *                software to stop "due to internal errors."
  *         RESOLUTION: The process queues for the ioMemory VSL software are now
  *                     balanced.
  * 
  * 
  * SOLARIS CHANGES
  * ---------------
  * 
  * Fixed Solaris Issues
  * 
  *         ISSUE: The reported VSL software CPU consumption on Solaris was 100%.
  *         RESOLUTION: CPU consumption on Solaris is now decreased.
