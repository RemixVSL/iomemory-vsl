# IOMemory-VSL (Driver version 3.x)
This is an unsupported update of the original driver source for FusionIO cards. It comes with no warranty, it may cause DATA LOSS or CORRUPTION. It is designed for "VSL3" i.e. the first few generations of cards. Newer cards would require VSL4 (see below). You cannot use VSL4 on the older cards, and vice versa. 

# IOMemory-VSL4 (Driver version 4.x)
For the iomemory-vsl4 driver please go to the [iomemory-vsl4](https://github.com/RemixVSL/iomemory-vsl4) repo.

# How to Identify your Fusion-io Card (including VSL version)
 Please refer to the [Fusion-io and OEM Part Numbers Matrix](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQMd40liekOCeftUYQx6GeofHgjU5SSDT-jHWid03JCfswQxHAhVee3rW-04baqKg1qN2fp7wEzuFm6/pubhtml).

## Background
Driver support for FusionIO cards has been lagging behind kernel releases, effectively making these cards an expensive paperweight when running a distribution like Ubuntu / Arch / Fedora / ProxMox which all supply newer kernels than supported by the original drivers.

## Releases
We've abandoned the notion of releases, Generally `main` should be checked out. `main` is completely backwards compatible for all **5**, and **6** kernels. The latest working tested kernel is **6.9**.

Historically releases were tagged, and were be checked out by their tag. The release tags follow Linux Kernel versions. E.g. **v5.12.1 (A Fine Boi)** will work on all 5.x kernels that are 5.12 and lower, but is not guaranteed to work on 5.13. **v4.20.2 - Grey Dawn** supports most kernels that pre-date 5.0. Again this way of following kernel releases has been abandoned. Please follow **main**.

| Tag | Codename |
| --- | --- |
| v5.12.1 | [A Fine Boi](https://i.imgur.com/SrtYVIr.jpeg) |
| v5.10.0 | [Fatto Catto](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1S69FTdTS8g) |
| v5.6.0 | [MEGACHONKER](https://www.reddit.com/r/Chonkers/) |
| v4.20.3 | [Grey Dawn](https://southpark.cc.com/clips/154175/crazy-old-drivers) |

## Important Note for newer Linux Kernels
Starting with Linux kernel 5.4.0, significant changes to the kernel were made that require additional boot time kernel flags for this driver to work. These affect AMD CPUs starting with 5.4.0, and Intel CPUs after about kernel 5.8.0. 

### Grub
When using grub as your boot loader, add the following to your /etc/default/grub by looking for `GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=""` and adding additional parameters inside the quotes.

For AMD systems:
```
amd_iommu=on iommu=pt
```
For Intel system:
```
iommu=pt
```

Example:
```GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet iommu=pt"```

### Systemd-boot
When using `systemd-boot` add the above options to the `options` section of the `.conf` file you're using as your loader. Typically the loader root will be `/EFI`, `/efi`, or `/boot`. Which will have a `loader/entries/` directory that contains your specific configuration files. Use your favourite editor. More information on `systemd-boot` can be found [here](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/systemd-boot#Adding_loaders).

## Versions
The driver is derived from the original `iomemory-vsl-3.2.16.1732`, but has several fixes and gone through rigorous cleaning of redundant unused and old code. Active development is done on branches and merged back to `main` (formerly master) when stable.

The modified source fixes several known bugs in the driver:
- silent IO drops
- crashes during driver unload
- SCSI queue settings
- BIO status handling

## Important note!!!
PRs and commits to `main` have gone through testing with Flexible I/O Tester. Testing for page_cache errors, and generic FIO checksumming on read and write and different block sizes. Non `main` branches are often in process of verification and under active development, and guaranteed not stable.

## Building
Note! For many systems, **the best option is to use DKMS**, using the [instructions below](https://github.com/RemixVSL/iomemory-vsl/blob/main/README.md#dkms). If you prefer to build the module directly, or to create a `dpkg` or `rpm` package, you can proceed with these options below. 

Please make sure that the required dependencies are installed, as mentioned in this [README](https://github.com/RemixVSL/iomemory-vsl/blob/main/README)

## Installation
DKMS is recommended, but installation can also be done with packages or from source.

### DKMS
Dynamic Kernel Module Support automates away the requirement of having to repackage the kernel module with every kernel and headers update that takes place on the system. This mechanism also makes sure that the driver for the new kernel actually works, or if the source needs refreshing.

Try building from `main` first as it works with most modern kernels:
```
git clone https://github.com/RemixVSL/iomemory-vsl
cd iomemory-vsl/
sudo make dkms
```

If you know you need to build a specific branch based on a specific recommendation, use:
```
git clone https://github.com/RemixVSL/iomemory-vsl
cd iomemory-vsl/
# OPTIONAL: Checkout a specific release. Usually using main branch is correct.
# DO THIS ONLY IF YOU'VE BEEN TOLD IT'S REQUIRED!
git checkout <release-tag>
sudo make dkms
```

### Source
```
git clone https://github.com/RemixVSL/iomemory-vsl
cd iomemory-vsl/
# OPTIONAL: Checkout a specific release. Usually using main branch is correct.
# DO THIS ONLY IF YOU'VE BEEN TOLD IT'S REQUIRED!
# git checkout <release-tag>
make module
sudo insmod root/usr/src/iomemory-vsl-3.2.16/iomemory-vsl.ko
```
### .deb Ubuntu / Debian
```
git clone https://github.com/RemixVSL/iomemory-vsl
cd iomemory-vsl
# OPTIONAL: Checkout a specific release. Usually using main branch is correct.
# DO THIS ONLY IF YOU'VE BEEN TOLD IT'S REQUIRED!
# git checkout <release-tag>
make dpkg
```

### .rpm CentOS / RHEL
```
git clone https://github.com/RemixVSL/iomemory-vsl
cd iomemory-vsl/
# OPTIONAL: Checkout a specific release. Usually using main branch is correct.
# DO THIS ONLY IF YOU'VE BEEN TOLD IT'S REQUIRED!
# git checkout <release-tag>
make rpm
```

# Utils
The utilities to query and manage the drive(s) can be found in the [vsl_downloads](https://github.com/RemixVSL/vsl_downloads) repo.

After installing the utilities and using `fio-status -a` something as follows should be printed:
```

## Notes
Installing the fio-util, fio-common, fio-preinstall and fio-sysvinit are recommended.
When moving from source 2.3.11 to source 3.2.10 the firmware HAS TO BE UPDATED to 3.2.10.20150212. For the move to 3.2.15, and 3.2.16 from 3.2.10 we've not seen any issues.

## Firmware
Though the newer the firmware often the better. If your card is not supported with the latest firmware drop by the Discord channel and someone might be able to help you.
